# Roles
At the beginning of each game, each player is dealt a role card that determines their win conditions.
The cards representing these roles don't matter especially much but should have opaque backed card sleeves to ensure anonymity.
Unless otherwise specified, role cards must be kept hidden from other players (face down)
Only the first two roles are mandatory. Various combinations of the others may be added to spice things up.
Some roles require that specific cards be used.

# Bomb Squad
A member of the bomb squad wants to cut all of the wires in order to diffuse the bomb.

# Terrorist Collaborator
Collaborators want the bomb to explode, either by the bomb card being cut or by the final round ending without all of the wires being cut.

# Thrill Seeker (bomb squad, or terrorist)
The thrill seeker wants some excitement! In order to win, they must first ensure the colored wires are diffused. After that, his goal is aligned with one of the basic teams.
Required cards: colored wires.

# Terrorist Sympathizer
The sympathizer wants the bomb to go off, but doesn't want anyone to get hurt. They only win if the final round ends without all of the wires being cut.

# Lucky Jack (bomb squad)
Lucky Jack is a member of the bomb squad who can reveal the bomb once per game without setting it off, but must reveal his role (turn face up) at that time.
His objective is the same as the bomb squad.

# The Hunter (terrorist) and the Rescuer (bomb squad)
These are special team members who may have an additional once per game ability that they can perform at the cost of revealing their role. 
The Hunter is typically used to encourage people to not talk about their role.
The Rescuer is typically used to give the bomb squad a hail Mary for when things are spiralling out of control.
The exact rules vary. See [Variants.md]
