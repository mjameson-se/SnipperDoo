# SnipperDoo
Fast-paced hidden role bomb diffusion game, for five or more players.

# Components
* Role cards, at least one per player.
* 30 item cards, or 5 per player 
* One pair of scissors, or any arbitrary token to substitute - this isn't that kind of legacy game.

# Basics
Before starting the game, each player is dealt one role card which determines their win condition (ie all wires cut, or not).
The game is played in rounds where each player is dealt a hand of cards which they are allowed to view before shuffling them and laying them face down in front of themselves, spread out so they can be individually identified and potentially cut.
Starting with the player who was cut last, or chosen by random means for the first round, a number of "cuts" are made equal to the number of players. Players may not cut their own cards. 
When a card is cut, it is flipped face up and its effect, if any, is applied.
