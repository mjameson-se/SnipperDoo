# SnipperDoo
Fast-paced hidden role bomb diffusion game, for five or more players.

# The Story
You and your colleagues have been called in to diffuse a bomb set in an iconic historical site.
Civilians are being evacuated from the blast radius, but if the bomb goes off too soon, there will be many deaths. If you fail to diffuse the bomb, we face losing a major symbol of national pride. 
We haven't figured out who is responsible yet, so assume they could have someone on the inside.
So, no pressure huh? Oh one more thing: it's on a timer. I guess the terrorists thought we wouldn't find it so soon, so we have that going for us,
but if you can't diffuse it in time, we'll have to pull you out. Good luck.

# Components
* [Role](./Roles.md) cards, at least one per player.
* 30 [item card](./Cards.md), or 5 per player 
* One pair of scissors, or any arbitrary token to substitute - this isn't that kind of legacy game.

# Basics
Before starting the game, each player is dealt one role card which determines their win condition (ie all wires cut, or not).
The game is played in rounds where each player is dealt a hand of cards which they are allowed to view before shuffling them and laying them face down in front of themselves, spread out so they can be individually identified and potentially cut.
Starting with the player who was cut last, or chosen by random means for the first round, a number of "cuts" are made equal to the number of players. Players may not cut their own cards. 
When a card is cut, it is flipped face up and its effect, if any, is applied.



# Legal Disclaimer
SnipperDoo started out with somebody who heard the basic idea of Timebomb and couldn't find it for sale in the U.S. so we made our own from things we had handy. Very quickly we saw the need to make some improvements to increase the depth. At this point, it hardly resembles the original game we played.
However, none of us know how the bits inspired by Timebomb ought to be treated from a legal/IP persective. All the bits we've added are licensed under CC0.
